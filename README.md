# Day 3: SQL for Data Analysis â€“ E-commerce Dataset

##  Objective:
Extract and analyze data from an e-commerce SQL database to understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

##  Tools:
- MYSQL
  

##  Dataset:
**Ecommerce_SQL_Database** with the following tables:
- Customers
- Orders
- Products
- Order_Details

##  Tasks Performed:
- SELECT queries to extract specific fields
- Filtering with `WHERE` clauses
- Sorting using `ORDER BY`
- Aggregation with `GROUP BY` and functions like `SUM`, `AVG`
- `JOINS` across tables to create relational insights
- Subqueries to compare grouped data
- Creating `VIEWS` for reusability
- Indexing columns to optimize query speed

##  Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience in querying, joining, and analyzing structured relational data using SQL.  
All queries and corresponding outputs are included in this repository for reference and learning purposes.
